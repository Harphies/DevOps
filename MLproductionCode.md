## Machine Learning IN production Environmnet

## Stages to write Production code for

- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection
- Model Development

## Code to

- Create and Transform features
- Incorporate the feature selection
- Build Machine Learning Model
- Score new data

## Notes

- We do not deploy model using jupiter Notebooks, we deploy using python scripts
- We write production code using procedural style of coding

  - Training script : load the data preprocess it and train the model
  - Scoring scripts : score the model and save it.

- We write production code with OOP programming style
